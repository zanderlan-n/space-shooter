Creating the Executable
=======================
For ``Windows`` based systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `cx_freeze <http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/>`__ was used to create the excutable for Windows based systems

2. Use the `setup.py <https://github.com/tasdikrahman/spaceShooter/blob/master/setup.py>`__ file for building the executable.

3. Go to the directory ``spaceShooter`` and then run the command

.. code:: python

    $ python setup.py build

This will create a new folder inside ``spaceShooter``.

4. Rename it and zip that file
